NoteStream
==========
A Meteor webapp written for the 2014 Meteor Hackathon. 
An MVP for the NoteStream product - a web app for modern notetaking. Here, both student and teacher can annotate pdf slides on individual layers, and toggle views to determine the volume of notes they wish to view. The application simultaneously supports in-class Q&A as well as student to student file sharing and collaboration.
